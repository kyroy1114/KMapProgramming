# KMapProgramming
This is a C/C++ program to read in a Boolean equation, making the corresponding Karnaugh Map and computing the minimum form of sum of product.

**The program is taking the test and needs to optimizing. Hence, remark this is not the final version.
The updated version will be uploaded if I modify the content.**

Please put the source code file and test.txt in the same directory before compiling or executing.
